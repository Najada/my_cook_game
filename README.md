My Cook 

For this project you will have to make a game inspired by Cook Serve Delicious. Your main challenge for this game will be to create nice and smooth user interface and menus. Your game will have to follow these rules:

The player is a cook in a restaurant.
Orders will appear randomly to the player.
Orders will have a limited time to be done.
Orders will be of different types.
The player will have to choose the right ingredients in the right order.
Having a pleasant user interface is one of the details that makes a good quality game, this project is the occasion for you to try your best on that topic.
